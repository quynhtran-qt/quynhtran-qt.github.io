Welcome to my first post!
First, let me introduce myself:
    My name is Quynh Tran, I am a senior CIT major, I will be graduated in Spring 2021. 

Second, let focus on the technical site of what I have learned in the first week
    Steps to set up Jekyll on my local machine

        1. I set up homebrew on my MacOs
            # Install Homebrew: 
/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
        2. I used homebrew to install the new version of Ruby
            # brew install ruby
        3. Add ruby path to shell config
            # echo 'export PATH="/usr/local/opt/ruby/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bash_profile
        4. Reload terminal and check the current version of ruby (Jekyll need Ruby verision 2.5 and above)
            # which ruby
            # ruby -v
        5. Install Jekyll 
            # gem install --user-install bundler jekyll
        6. Append the path file with the new Ruby version
            # echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.gem/ruby/2.7.0/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bash_profile
        7. Check the gem path
            # gem env
        8. I downloaded theme Memoirs, unzip the folder and build the jekyll theme
            # gem install bundler
            # bundle install
        9. Create a new post: navigate to folder _posts and create first blog
            # 2020-09-04-blog-0.md 
        10. The general info about the static page can be changed using _config.yml

Thank you for going through my 1st blog.
Take care, and see you next week
